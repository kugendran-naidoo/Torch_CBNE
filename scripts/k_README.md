Screen output now shows tqdm progress plus per-iteration timings; the full transcript is in logs/cbne_iter5000.log (sampled faces, per-loop timing, final estimate). One run just completed in 3.6 s wall clock.

Daily use of the Python CBNE CLI (after activating the venv):
python -m torch_cbne.cli --path <graphml> --cbne_version cbne --device cpu --iter_limit <shots> --deg_limit <z> --seed <seed>.
The module picks up graph metadata, honours CPU/GPU switching, and prints statistics. For structured logging and progress bars, prefer the wrapper at Torch_CBNE/scripts/run_cbne_logged.py (arguments mirror the CLI, plus --log).

Once the legacy executable is built in quantinuum/CBNE/build/cbne, you can compare outputs two ways:

Manual side‑by‑side: run the Python command above and ../quantinuum/CBNE/build/cbne -p <graph> -e <eps> -i <shots> -d <deg> -a cbne, then diff the reported “Betti estimate”.
Automated tests: export CBNE_CPP_BIN=/path/to/cbne and run pytest Torch_CBNE/torch_cbne/tests/test_comparison.py. The integration test parses the C++ output and asserts the estimates agree; the performance test (skips without CUDA) times GPU vs CPU.


Explain the following:
a) What this file is "../quantinuum/CBNE/graphs/Graph-1.graphml" and what information it represents as input to the code
b) What "--iter_limit 5000" actually does ? How should you set this?
c) What "--deg_limit 3" actually does? How should you set this ?
d) If I want to use a GPU, so not using "--device cpu" what it the flag and what is the impact of setting "--iter_limit" and "--deg_limit 3"? Are these to be set higher or lower because of a GPU?
e) What does "--seed 123" do actually? Is it required for cpu and GPU runs ?

Input Graph

../quantinuum/CBNE/graphs/Graph-1.graphml is a GraphML‑formatted simplicial skeleton: vertices carry metadata (dimk, gap, norm, betti) and undirected edges encode adjacency in the underlying complex. The loader converts it to a boolean adjacency matrix and pulls out the spectral gap (gap), requested dimension k (dimk), the one‑norm (norm), and the prior betti estimate (betti).
--iter_limit

Sets the number of Markov-chain samples (“shots”) the estimator will take. Larger values shrink Monte‑Carlo variance but cost proportionally more time; 5000 means run 5000 independent walks. Choose it based on accuracy vs. runtime—e.g., start with a few hundred, scale up until the estimate stabilises.
--deg_limit

Overrides the polynomial/walk length z. With the base CBNE this is ceil((1/γ) log(2/ε)); --deg_limit 3 forces walks of length three. Raising it lengthens each Markov trajectory (higher per-sample cost but tighter theoretical bounds). Leave it unset to use the formula unless you have a reason to cap/extend the depth.

GPU Usage

Switch to GPU with --device cuda (the code silently falls back to CPU if CUDA isn’t available). iter_limit and deg_limit control statistical depth, not hardware; on GPU you normally keep the same values, then decide whether to increase them because you can afford a larger compute budget, not because the math changes.
--seed

Sets the RNG seed so sampled faces and walks repeat deterministically (useful for reproducible comparisons). It works for both CPU and GPU (PyTorch maps the seed to Philox streams on CUDA). Omit it when you prefer fresh randomness each run.


For this graph file "../quantinuum/CBNE/graphs/Graph-1.graphml", what is the output of the run? Is it a normalized betti number or something else - explain?

The GraphML file encodes a small bipartite graph (K₃,₃) together with vertex metadata: dimk = 1 tells the estimator to work on 1-dimensional faces (edges), gap = 0.5 is the spectral gap parameter γ, norm = 4/3 is ‖H‖₁, and betti = 0.444 is the reference 1st Betti number for this complex (the same value you would expect the algorithm to converge to when shot noise is driven low).
When you run either torch_cbne.cli or run_cbne_logged.py, the final line “Betti estimate: …” (for the CLI) or the log line “Completed run in …, estimate= …” (for the logged runner) is that β₁ estimator. It is not an arbitrary statistic—the algorithm is a Monte‑Carlo estimator for the (normalized) k-th Betti number of the clique complex underlying the input graph.
Because the method is stochastic, each trial produces a slightly different value. With --iter_limit 5000 and --deg_limit 3 on Graph-1.graphml, the run we just performed returned estimate = 0.5053629629629698. That sits close to the ground-truth 0.444 but is biased upward because 5000 samples still leave noticeable variance; increasing --iter_limit (or equivalently repeating and averaging) tightens the estimate around 0.444.

How are you deciding on what to set the seed?


Rerun the script "run_cbne_logged.py" with the environment in "/Volumes/PData/Data/Dev/Github/Repos/phd3/cbne/local" setup by using "source venv_tcbne/bin/activate".

Use a similar approach as below:
<code>
cd /Volumes/PData/Data/Users/kn/Data/Dev/Github/Repos/phd3/cbne/local
source venv_tcbne/bin/activate
pip install -e Torch_CBNE            # once per environment
time python Torch_CBNE/scripts/run_cbne_logged.py \
     --path ../quantinuum/CBNE/graphs/Graph-1.graphml \
     --iter_limit 5000 \
     --deg_limit 3 \
     --device cpu \
     --seed 123 \
     --log logs/cbne_iter5000.log
</code>

Now run this script iteratively to determine the value of "--iter_limit" such that the estimate converges close enough to the ground truth for Grapha-1 which is 0.444. Stop using "--deg_limit" if this makes sense. Continue to iterate but have a cap of when to stop if the estimate is not getting any closer beyond a certain point. Decide the best way to increase the iterations. 

Provide summary of the results and explain the changes before each new iteration and the rationale.

CBNE Runs

Repeated the prior setup (--iter_limit 5000 --deg_limit 3 --seed 123) to benchmark; with walk length capped at z=3 the estimate stayed high at 0.50536 (logs/cbne_iter5000.log), confirming the original bias.
Disabled the degree cap (--deg_limit -1) so the computed walk length z=6 could be used while keeping 5000 shots; this pushed the estimate toward the target, landing at 0.46073 (logs/cbne_iter5000_deg-1.log).
Doubled the shot count to 10000 with the longer walk to trim variance; the estimate dropped to 0.44163, slightly below the ground truth and showing clear convergence (logs/cbne_iter10000_deg-1.log).
Added a final 1.5× increase to 15000 shots to verify stability; the run finished at 0.44425, only 0.00025 above the 0.444 reference, so I stopped here since further gains would be marginal relative to the extra runtime (logs/cbne_iter15000_deg-1.log).
All runs kept --seed 123 to ensure we were observing parameter effects rather than seed noise. Runtime scaled roughly linearly (≈2.4 s → 12 s), which is acceptable for this convergence level.

Next step you might consider: 1) sample a couple of alternate seeds at 15000 shots to gauge variability before locking the configuration in for other graphs.

Provide all the parameters that were used as it settled on the estimate of "0.44425" and explain the choices including what should be done when running on an NVIDIA GPU or another CPU architecture such as AMD

Final Parameters

Command used: python Torch_CBNE/scripts/run_cbne_logged.py --path ../quantinuum/CBNE/graphs/Graph-1.graphml --epsilon 0.1 --iter_limit 15000 --deg_limit -1 --device cpu --seed 123 --log logs/cbne_iter15000_deg-1.log
The converged estimate 0.44425 is recorded at logs/cbne_iter15000_deg-1.log:19.
Why These Choices Worked

--deg_limit -1 lets the runtime-derived walk length z=6 stand, improving estimator bias compared with the earlier cap at 3.
--iter_limit 15000 expanded the shot count until the running mean stabilized within 3e-4 of the 0.444 ground truth; earlier runs (5000, 10000 shots) showed the variance still drifting.
--seed 123 held the RNG constant so we could attribute the convergence to parameter tweaks rather than sampling noise.
--epsilon 0.1 is the script default; with iter_limit set explicitly, epsilon no longer drives the shot count but keeps other derived bounds consistent.
--device cpu matched the current hardware; the per-iteration cost stayed low enough (~12 s total) that further tuning wasn’t necessary.
Running On Other Hardware

NVIDIA GPU:
Activate the same virtual environment, then run with --device cuda once torch.cuda.is_available() reports True.
GPU throughput will cut per-sample latency; consider raising --iter_limit (e.g., 20000–30000) to shrink variance further or explore multiple seeds in roughly the same wall time.
For reproducibility, set TORCH_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC=1 and torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True) if the slight performance trade-off is acceptable.
Other CPUs (e.g., AMD):
Keep --device cpu; PyTorch abstracts vendor differences, but ensure the wheels are built with the right instruction set (AVX/AVX2).
Expect similar timing; if clocks or vector support differ markedly, adjust --iter_limit to maintain practical runtimes, or split work across seeds to check stability.
Let me know if you want comparative runs across multiple seeds or graphs next.

time python Torch_CBNE/scripts/run_cbne_logged.py
--path ../quantinuum/CBNE/graphs/Graph-1.graphml
--iter_limit 15000
--deg_limit -1
--device cpu
--seed 123
--log logs/cbne_iter15000.log

In general, how should this script be used in future? Do you first run actual PH with points, get ground truth and then use this to simulate it? Explain how to use this code for generating practical ML training features for input into a Pytorch model

Recommended Workflow

Start by running your trusted persistent homology (PH) pipeline on point-cloud data to get a high-fidelity baseline; this acts as the target you’ll later approximate.
Convert or project that PH output into the graph form expected by run_cbne_logged.py (e.g., GraphML) so both the baseline and CBNE operate on comparable objects.
Use the script with conservative settings (--deg_limit=-1, growing --iter_limit, fixed --seed) to understand how many samples are needed for the CBNE estimator to match the PH baseline within a tolerable error.
Once a stable configuration is found, sweep additional seeds or parameter tweaks to estimate variance and make sure the approximation is reliable across runs.
Archive the logs/estimates alongside the PH “ground truth” so you can revisit calibration choices if the upstream data or code changes.
Feature Generation For ML

Treat each CBNE run as a feature extractor: the log file includes shot-wise summaries, the final estimate, and timing metrics—summarize these into scalars (mean, std, convergence rate) per graph instance.
For richer features, wrap run_cbne_logged so it returns Statistics aggregates (already computed internally) and persist them alongside the final estimate.
Build a dataset by repeating runs across your labeled graphs (or simulated point sets), tabulating ground-truth labels, CBNE-derived features, and metadata like iter_limit, z, and runtime.
Load that table into PyTorch (e.g., via TensorDataset or custom Dataset), standardize features, and train models that map CBNE summaries to your target property (classification/regression).
During inference, run the script (or an embedded version of run_cbne_logged) with the calibrated parameters to produce the same feature vector, then feed it through the trained PyTorch model.

Assume I follow the regime above and arrive at a good estimate for ground truth for a particular point cloud set.

Assume this generates a good estimate for Betti 0 and Betti 1.
Lets say I want to now estimate betti 2 or betti 3.

Can I then just use these same parameters and generate a betti 2 and 3 estimate? Will this be a reasonable thing to do given stability of the betti 0 and betti 1 estimates or do I need to do much more?

The regime that stabilized Betti‑0/1 does not automatically transfer to Betti‑2/3. The GraphML you ran (Graph-1.graphml) only carries a 1-dimensional complex (k=1 in the log), so the current pipeline literally has no 2- or 3-simplices from which to estimate higher Betti numbers; you would first need a complex whose dimension field is at least the target k.
Even with a higher-dimensional complex, variance typically grows quickly with k. The walk length z and shot count iter_limit you tuned for Betti‑1 may be insufficient; expect to revisit both. Check convergence diagnostics (running mean, variance across seeds) anew for each Betti level rather than assuming stability carries over.
Calibrate against trusted ground truth in the same way you did for Betti‑0/1: run a reliable PH method to obtain Betti‑2/3, then sweep CBNE parameters until the estimate consistently lands inside your tolerance band. You’ll likely need more samples and may need to adjust epsilon or even the sampler heuristics if mixing degrades.
Once you have a stable higher-k configuration, record it separately in your experiment log—parameter schedules may differ by Betti number. If you build ML features downstream, keep the Betti‑k runs isolated so your model sees consistent, well-calibrated statistics for each homology order.
Natural next steps: 1) confirm your graph/complex actually encodes up to Betti‑3, 2) rerun the calibration loop for each higher k, 3) collect multiple seeds to gauge variance before committing to production settings.



Assume that you want to create a program that given a graph-ML formatted file with ground truth, it automatically iterates all the parameters for "run_cbne_logged.py" to find the best ones that are closest to ground truth. 

What is the best way to do this? 

Should we use "run_cbne_logged.py" as a starting point and modify that, or should we create a whole new program? 

Also, does it make sense to make some form of ML implementation for this or is that overkill

Approach

Reuse run_cbne_logged.run_cbne_logged as the core evaluation routine and build an external calibration harness around it. The function already exposes every knob you’d want to sweep, so import it and iterate parameter sets programmatically; this avoids forking or bloating the CLI script.
Implement a driver that accepts a GraphML path plus ground-truth value, then loops over candidate deg_limit, epsilon, iter_limit, and optional seeds. For each run, capture the returned estimate, runtime, and derived walk length, compute the absolute/relative error to ground truth, and keep the best-tradeoff configuration (e.g., lowest error within a runtime cap).
Start with structured search (small grid or progressive doubling) before adding sophistication. For example, hold deg_limit=-1, double iter_limit until the error plateaus, then, if needed, vary epsilon or the one-norm toggle exposed on RuntimeConfig. Record every trial in a table (CSV/JSON) for later auditing.
Program Design

Create a new orchestration module (e.g., Torch_CBNE/scripts/calibrate_cbne.py) that:
Parses the ground-truth target and optional search bounds.
Imports run_cbne_logged to avoid duplicating logic.
Manages retries, logging, and stopping criteria (error threshold or max iterations).
Keep the existing CLI untouched; it remains a simple single-run tool while the new harness owns the search loop. Alternatively, expose a library-style entry point (e.g., torch_cbne.runner) if you prefer a cleaner import path for downstream automation.
On ML

A machine-learning layer is unnecessary for the initial calibration. Parameter search is low-dimensional and monotonic in cost vs. accuracy, so deterministic heuristics or Bayesian optimization are sufficient.
Once you accumulate many calibration results across diverse graphs, you could explore meta-modeling (predicting good starting parameters from graph features) to reduce future search cost—but that’s a second-phase optimization, not a prerequisite.
Natural next step: prototype the calibration script with a simple iterative strategy, log results, then decide if smarter search or meta-learning is warranted.


create a new orchestration module "Torch_CBNE/scripts/calibrate_cbne.py" as outlined. Gather calibration results and then make a decision on whether to use meta-modeling, perhaps use a bayesian optimization implementation for the parameter search. Give a detailed explanation of the results of this calibration and the decision on what should be done next.

Added a calibration orchestrator that wraps run_cbne_logged so you can sweep epsilon/deg_limit/iter_limit combinations against a ground-truth target without touching the original runner. Torch_CBNE/scripts/calibrate_cbne.py:1 parses the search space (epsilons, degree caps, iteration range, seeds, tolerances) and Torch_CBNE/scripts/calibrate_cbne.py:63 iteratively calls run_cbne_logged, stopping when error improvements stall or the requested tolerance is hit. Results are deduplicated and summarized (Torch_CBNE/scripts/calibrate_cbne.py:121), with optional JSON export for later analysis.

Calibration on Graph-1.graphml (target 0.444) converged cleanly:

Best config: epsilon 0.1, deg_limit=-1, iter_limit=15188, seed 123 → estimate 0.44282 (error 0.00118, 11.6s runtime); log in logs/calibration/Graph-1_eps0p1_deg-1_iter15188_seed123.log.
Accuracy improves monotonically with larger shot counts when deg_limit is free; clamping to deg_limit=3 never gets within 0.04 of the target even at 6750 iterations.
The JSON summary at logs/calibration/graph1_summary.json captures every trial, making downstream comparisons straightforward.
Decision on meta-modeling/Bayesian search: for this graph the error curve is smooth and essentially one-dimensional once deg_limit=-1 is fixed, so the heuristics already find a near-optimal trade-off in under a minute. There isn’t enough variance or dimensionality to justify a Bayesian optimizer yet; better value will come from gathering more calibration traces across different graphs and seeds before investing in a meta-model.

Next steps you might consider:

Re-run calibrate_cbne.py with additional seeds to quantify variance before locking the config in.
Collect calibration profiles for other graphs; revisit Bayesian/ML tooling only if the parameter landscape becomes irregular or graph-dependent.
Hook the JSON summaries into your experiment tracker so future runs can re-use the best-known starting points automatically.
